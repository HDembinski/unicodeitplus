Convert simple LaTeX into an unicode approximation and paste it anywhere.

This package provides a more complete LaTeX to Unicode converter than `unicodeit <https://github.com/svenkreiss/unicodeit/>`_. ``unicodeitplus`` uses a better parser (generated from EBNF with the fantastic `Lark library <https://github.com/lark-parser/lark>`_) than ``unicodeit``, which handles some code on which ``unicodeit`` fails, and allows one to parse a mix of text and math code, like::

    $p_T$ / GeV $c^{-1}$

I want to eventually merge this project into ``unicodeit``, discussions with the maintainer of ``unicodeit`` are ongoing.

LaTeX to Unicode: How does this even work?
------------------------------------------
Unicode contains many subscript and superscript characters. It also contains font variations of characters of both latin and greek characters, including italic, boldface, bold italic, and more. It contains a lot of special mathematical characters and diacritical marks, which we use to approximate LaTeX renderings using just unicode characters.

Like ``unicodeit``, ``unicodeitplus`` is largely based on ``unimathsymbols.txt`` from Günter Milde, which is maps LaTeX macros to Unicode symbols.

Caveats
-------
- Only a subset of all LaTeX code can be converted to Unicode. Some Unicode characters simply don't exist. For example, subscript characters exist only for a subset of all lowercase latin characters, there are no subscript characters for uppercase latin characters, and all subscript or superscript characters are in roman font (upright).
- Some code is rendered the best best approximation, for example, ``p_T`` as ``𝑝ₜ``, assuming that a reasonable approximation is preferred over a failed conversion.
- Your font needs to contain glyphs for the Unicode characters, otherwise you will typically see a little box with the unicode character index.
- The visually best results seem to be obtained with monospace fonts.
